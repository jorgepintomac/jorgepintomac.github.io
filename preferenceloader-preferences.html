THEOS is a very nice and easy-to-use build system for the common iPhone jailbroken programmer. It has a nice template system, easy build process, a stable code base. In short words, everything a developer could whish himself. But there is one problem: Error messages. Nobody likes error messages, they tell you what you made wrong but they don't tell you how to do it right. This is a quite destructive procedure and one's motivation will fly away like a sheet of paper in a stormy night. This page has one goal: To give every error message a face and a complete way to fix. To make it easier for you to find your error i came up with a text structure:<br><br><br>
<h4>Short error description</h4>
Long error description. Where appears it, when, under which conditions.

The fix. How to fix this error, along with an explanation.<br><br><br><br>
Okay enough of this, let's dive into it!

<h4>Linker not finding CydiaSubstrate</h4>
The linker cannot find the symbols for the various CydiaSubstrate functions, on which mostly all tweaks rely.
This error happens when you try to directly use substrate functions with Ryan Petrichs theos fork.
<pre><code>
root@bash# make
Making all for tweak librarian...
Preprocessing Tweak.xm...
Compiling Tweak.xm (armv7)...
Linking tweak librarian (armv7)...
Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
  "_MSHookFunction", referenced from:
      _logosLocalCtor_ee39cf58() in Tweak.xm.5af61362.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make[3]: *** [.theos/obj/armv7/librarian.dylib] Error 1
make[2]: *** [.theos/obj/armv7/librarian.dylib] Error 2
make[1]: *** [internal-library-all_] Error 2
make: *** [librarian.all.tweak.variables] Error 2
</code></pre>
As he explained on IRC to me, rpetrich disliked that substrate is being linked by default to every tweak project, so he changed the beaviour. You can fix this easily by adding "[tweak]_LIBRARIES = substrate" to your Makefile.
