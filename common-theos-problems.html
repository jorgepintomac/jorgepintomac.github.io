<h2>The most common THEOS build system problems</h2>
THEOS is a very nice and easy-to-use build system for the common iPhone jailbroken programmer. It has a nice template system, easy build process, a stable code base. In short words, everything a developer could whish himself. But there is one problem: Error messages. Nobody likes error messages, they tell you what you made wrong but they don't tell you how to do it right. This is a quite destructive procedure and one's motivation will fly away like a sheet of paper in a stormy night. This page has one goal: To give every error message a face and a complete way to fix. To make it easier for you to find your error, I came up with a text structure:<br><br><br>
<h4>Short error description</h4>
Long error description. Where does it appear, when, under which conditions.
<pre><code>
Example of a real error dump.
Example: Making all for tweak watchscreen...
</pre></code>
The fix. How to fix this error, along with an explanation.<br><br><br><br>
Okay enough of this, let's dive into it!
<hr>
<h4>Linker not finding CydiaSubstrate</h4>
The linker cannot find the symbols for the various CydiaSubstrate functions, on which mostly all tweaks rely.
This error occurs when you try to directly use substrate functions with Ryan Petrichs theos fork. The Cydia Substrate binary is valid and in the correct "$THEOS/lib" directory.
<pre><code>
root@bash# make
Making all for tweak librarian...
Preprocessing Tweak.xm...
Compiling Tweak.xm (armv7)...
Linking tweak librarian (armv7)...
Undefined symbols for architecture armv7:
  "_MSHookFunction", referenced from:
      _logosLocalCtor_ee39cf58() in Tweak.xm.5af61362.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make[3]: *** [.theos/obj/armv7/librarian.dylib] Error 1
make[2]: *** [.theos/obj/armv7/librarian.dylib] Error 2
make[1]: *** [internal-library-all_] Error 2
make: *** [librarian.all.tweak.variables] Error 2
</code></pre>
As he explained on IRC to me, rpetrich disliked that substrate is being linked by default to every tweak project, so he changed the beaviour. You can fix this easily by adding "[tweak]_LIBRARIES = substrate" to your Makefile.
<hr>
<h4>Make package requires dpkg-deb</h4>
The dpkg command line tool is missing. This appears on an OS X installation. Xcode is installed and theos, ldid etc. are set up.
<pre><code>
root@bash$ make package install
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make package requires dpkg-deb.
make: *** [internal-package-check] Error 1
</code></pre>
You forgot to install dpkg. Get <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew from here</a> and then run "brew install dpkg" from a Terminal of your choice.
