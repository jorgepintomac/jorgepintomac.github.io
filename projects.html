I am working on various small projects and things in several programming languages like
C, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, AutoIT, Objective-C/Cocoa Touch, Logos, Lua, TIBasic and RoboPro.<br>
I am too lazy to count up every single code snippet i ever wrote, so contact me if you are
interested in any of these languages, i maybe have some cool stuff waiting for you.<br><br>
I am currently doing very much stuff in the (jailbroken) iPhone and Cocoa Touch and Logos and
MobileSubstrate (now CydiaSubstrate) and Objective-C direction so if you landed here by destiny
and want to learn about such stuff i am your man!<br><br>
I am also the guy who made watchscreen and ClassicLock Cydget, both available on Cydia, if you have a
jailbreak on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or iOS 7 or iOS 8.<br>
I have a Cydia repo now (most dedicated to iOS 6 stuff :P): <a href="http://h6nry.github.io/repo/">http://h6nry.github.io/repo/</a><br>
